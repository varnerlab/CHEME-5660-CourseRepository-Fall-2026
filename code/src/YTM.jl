"""
    function YTM(model::MyUSTreasuryZeroCouponBondModel, compounding::AbstractCompoundingModel; rₒ::Float64 = 0.01)::Float64

This function computes the Yield to Maturity (YTM) for a given bond model using the BFGS optimization algorithm. 
The YTM is the interest (discount) rate that minimizes the Net Present Value (NPV) of the zero coupon bond. 

### Arguments
- `model::MyUSTreasuryZeroCouponBondModel`: A zero coupon bond model that contains the bond data, sans the interest (discount) rate.
- `compounding::AbstractCompoundingModel`: The compounding model to use to compute the discount factors. The model can be an instance of either a [`DiscreteCompoundingModel`](@ref) or a [`ContinuousCompoundingModel`](@ref).

### Optional Arguments
- `rₒ::Float64 = 0.01`: The initial guess for the annual interest (discount) rate. The default value is `0.01`.

### Returns
- `Float64`: The annual interest (discount) rate that minimizes the NPV of the bond.
